## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture, comprising **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data is ingested from CSV files into the PostgreSQL databass and stores as raw data, originating from the source systems. 
2. **Silver Layer**: Involves data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Models the data into a star schema and houses as analytics-ready data for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables for efficient analytical queries.
4. **Data Analytics**: Using SQL queries for generating actionable insights.
